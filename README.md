# daemonMASTER

daemonMASTER is an innovative conversational tool platform that enables control over various bot instances. The name is a playful nod to both the concept of system daemons in the realm of computer science and the role of the Dungeon Master in tabletop role-playing games. Our platform gives life to rich "characters" - sophisticated chatbot instances that can be utilized in a variety of applications, beyond the realm of role-playing games.
